# Game Jam - Stuck in the loop

### 
This project is a 3-day Game Jam (a video game made from scratch in a limited 
time). This project was mandatory as a form of ending course 1ZHERV 
(ZÁKLADY HERNÍHO VÝVOJE). Theme `Stuck In The Loop` was assigned as a theme of 
the project by a lecturer.

The game can be downloaded as a project and build in unity, or you can play it 
online on [itch.io](https://christmasjam.itch.io/stuck-in-a-loop).
